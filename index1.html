        Greetings my name is Blair Betts and I am a current student of the UNC BootCamp program. I am a graduate from UNC Greensboro with a bachelors degree in communication studies. During my time at UNCG I also played baseball. Being a former collegiate athlete I am familar with the defintion of hard work and adveristy. I ehanced my time management skills as well as drive to be a perfectionist. While I understand perfection may not alwasys be achievable that is always the goal that I strive for. This is a trait that I took with me as I began my collegiate coaching career.

        Baseball however is just one demtion about me. I was rasied by a programmer and a music teacher so I have some creativity about me as well. I pursued my musical talents through high school and still revert back those skills ocasionaly. Having this mindset I tend to see things a little differently than normal. I'll constentally break things down but then give them my own little twist to them.
